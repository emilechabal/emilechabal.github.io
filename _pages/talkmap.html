<p>If you're anything like me, the pandemic will have made you nostalgic about academic and non-academic travel. In memory of better times &ndash; and in anticipation of a slightly happier future &ndash; I used some tools on this website to create a dynamic map of all the places I have given talks since 2015.</p> 

<p>Thank you to all the lovely people, friends and colleagues, who made this travel possible!</p>

<p>PS. Recordings of some of these talks can be found in the <a href="/talks/">press and media</a> section.</p>
