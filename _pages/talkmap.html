<p>I first built this website at the height of the pandemic, during which many of us were confined at home. This made me nostalgic about academic and non-academic travel, so I used some tools on this website to create a dynamic map of all the places I had given talks since 2015. As the world has opened up, I have added some of my more recent talk locations.</p> 

<p>Thank you to all the lovely friends and colleagues who made this travel possible!</p>

<p>PS. Recordings of some of these talks can be found in the <a href="/talks/">press and media</a> section.</p>
