<img src="/images/teaching.jpg" alt="Teaching" style="float:right;width:431px;height:321px;margin:0px 0px 10px 10px"> I was educated at Cambridge, Rice University, Harvard University and the École Normale Supérieure, Paris. I completed my PhD at Cambridge and my thesis was subsequently awarded the History Faculty's Prince Consort and Thirlwall Prize, and Seeley Medal for the best dissertation across all periods.

Immediately after completing my doctorate, I took up a position as a Departmental Lecturer in Modern European History in the Faculty of History and Balliol College, Oxford. I returned to Cambridge in 2012 as a Research Fellow in French Political History at St John's College. In 2013, I <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/history-classics-archaeology/history/about/staff-profiles/profile_tab1_academic.php?uun=echabal" target="_blank">moved to the University of Edinburgh</a> as a Chancellor's Fellow in History. I was promoted to Reader in 2018.

Much of my <a href="/portfolio/">research</a> until now has focused on France, in particular the transformation of French politics since the 1970s, Franco-British relations in the 20th century and the legacy of colonialism in France. This has led to a wide range of <a href="/publications/">publications</a> on subjects as varied as French republicanism, the idea of the 'Anglo-Saxon' in modern French thought, and the history of inter-community relations in Montpellier since the end of the Algerian War. I continue to work on different aspects of contemporary French politics, especially anti-capitalist thought and postwar French political culture, with the aim of elaborating imaginative new frameworks for understanding how politics works in France (and beyond).

My current project is an intellectual biography of the historian Eric Hobsbawm, for which I was awarded a two-year <a href="http://www.ed.ac.uk/history-classics-archaeology/history/news-events/ahrc-fellowship-emile-chabal" target="_blank">AHRC Leadership Fellowship</a> in 2017. Drawing on archives and oral history material, I use Hobsbawm's life and work to think through the history of twentieth-century global Marxism, as well as reflect on the nature of historical writing and the role of the intellectual. The project also includes a major digital humanities component, which takes the form of the first comprehensive <a href="https://hobsbawm.shca.ed.ac.uk" target="_blank">online Hobsbawm bibliography</a>. 

<img src="/images/weimarlecture.jpg" alt="Lecture" style="float:right;width:309px;height:206px;margin:0px 0px 10px 10px">In addition to my work on French and European history, I have a longstanding interesting in the politics of migration and immigration. As well as publising widely on this subject, I was a co-investigator on a major <a href="https://blogs.sps.ed.ac.uk/seeing-illegal-immigrants/" target="_blank">ESRC project on illegal migration and state rationality</a> from 2016 to 2018. 

I was the founder and director of the <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/history-classics-archaeology/modern-contemporary-history-centre" target="_blank">Centre for the Study of Modern and Contemporary History</a> from 2017 to 2020.

My other great passion is music. I hold an LRSM performing diploma on the classical guitar and, for many years, taught the instrument to unsuspecting students of all ages.
