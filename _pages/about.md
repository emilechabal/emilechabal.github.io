I was educated at Cambridge, Rice University, Harvard University and the École Normale Supérieure, Paris. I completed my PhD at Cambridge and my thesis was subsequently awarded the History Faculty's Prince Consort and Thirlwall Prize, and Seeley Medal for the best dissertation across all periods.

Immediately after completing my doctorate, I took up a position as a Departmental Lecturer in Modern European History in the Faculty of History and Balliol College, Oxford. I returned to Cambridge in 2012 as a Research Fellow in French Political History at St John's College. In 2013, I [moved to the University of Edinburgh as a Chancellor's Fellow in History](https://www.ed.ac.uk/history-classics-archaeology/history/about/staff-profiles/profile_tab1_academic.php?uun=echabal). I was promoted to Reader in 2018.

Much of my research until now has focused on France, in particular the transformation of French politics since the 1970s, Franco-British relations in the 20th century and the legacy of colonialism in France. This has led to a wide range of publications on subjects as varied as French republicanism, the idea of the 'Anglo-Saxon' in modern French thought, and the history of inter-community relations in Montpellier since the end of the Algerian War. My main aim has been to elaborate imaginative new frameworks for understanding contemporary political culture in France (and beyond).

My current project is an intellectual biography of the historian Eric Hobsbawm, for which I was awarded a two-year [AHRC Leadership Fellowship](http://www.ed.ac.uk/history-classics-archaeology/history/news-events/ahrc-fellowship-emile-chabal) in 2017. I use Hobsbawm's life and work to think through key themes in the history of twentieth-century Marxism, as well as reflect on the nature of historical writing and the role of the intellectual. Alongside this  project, I continue to work on different aspects of contemporary French politics, especially anti-capitalist thought and postwar French political culture.

In addition to my work on French and European history, I have a longstanding interesting in the politics of migration and immigration, and I was a co-investigator on a major [ESRC project on illegal migration and state rationality](https://blogs.sps.ed.ac.uk/seeing-illegal-immigrants/) from 2016 to 2018. I was also director of the [Centre for the Study of Modern and Contemporary History](https://www.ed.ac.uk/history-classics-archaeology/modern-contemporary-history-centre) from 2017 to 2020.

My other great passion is music. I hold an LRSM performing diploma on the classical guitar and, for many years, taught the instrument to unsuspecting students of all ages.
